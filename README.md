Text based game with a post modern twist

Aim of this project is to join up the learning from Python into a usable text based game that will have a battle system, inventory and puzzles.  
Mixing my love of post modernism with games.  There hopefully will be chatbots (a basic implementation of Eliza) that loop showing how meaningless langugae is and user input jumbled up.
